Coursera Data Sience: Getting and cleaning data

For this project I worked on the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset"

The new dataset created is described with following files:


-codebook.txt
explains the origin of the data and the steps which were performed to create the dataset data2.txt.

-readme.md
explains the purpose of each file in this project.

-run_analysis.R
contains the scripts for recreating the dataset data.txt from the original dataset.
